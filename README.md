## Purpose
This project should include all Java based automation projects with different approaches, user should pick anyone which he/she feels comfortable with. Since having multiple projects in single repository it will be very annoying to clone everything but we need to do this because we are working on other Automation projects with different languages and creating separate repo for each one will be headache.

## Where to start
Beginners can start form BasicSeleniumJava project, you can find the readme file for each project in the project directory separately.
